/*
 * The sine and cosine tables overlap, but "#define gCosineTable (gSineTable +
 * 0x400)" doesn't give expected codegen; gSineTable and gCosineTable need to
 * be different symbols for code to match. Most likely the tables were placed
 * adjacent to each other, and gSineTable cut short, such that reads overflow
 * into gCosineTable.
 *
 * These kinds of out of bounds reads are undefined behavior, and break on
 * e.g. GCC (which doesn't place the tables next to each other, and probably
 * exploits array sizes for range analysis-based optimizations as well).
 * Thus, for non-IDO compilers we use the standard-compliant version.
